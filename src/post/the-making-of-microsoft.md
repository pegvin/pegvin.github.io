It all started when a young Bill Gates & his friend Paul Allen wanted to make a business using their programming skills.

They wrote a [BASIC Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_interpreter) for the MITS Altair 8800 microcomputer and reached out to MITS about it.

Later they demonstrated it and MITS agreed to distribute it and marketed it as [Altair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC), and shortly followed the establishment of Microsoft, a company that wrote software for microcomputers.

As 1980s unfolded, IBM had something brewing up in their company. A Personal Computer (PC), or as it came to be, the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer).

IBM was looking for a OS for their IBM PC and scheduled a meeting with [Digital Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research) as they had a OS called [Control Program for Microcomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M), CPM in short.

Apparently Gary Kildall (Creator of CPM) just had a fight with his Wife and simply left the meeting, to cool off by flying his private plane.

Before disclosing about the meeting details, IBM wanted Kildall's Wife (company director) to sign non-disclosure agreements which she denied, thus ending the meeting and as it would turn out, making the fight between Gary & his wife the most expensive one.

Meanwhile making a name for themselves with their BASIC Interpreters, IBM reaches out to Microsoft for their interpreter and meetings with Bill Gates is setup.

Uncle Bill's eyes sparkled when he learns that IBM doesn't have an OS yet and offers IBM that he could provide them with a BASIC Interpreter AND a OS to run it on.

Microsoft didn't have an OS like that, so they reach out to a company named [Seattle Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Computer_Products) for their 86-DOS Operating System that was similar to CPM but optimized for Intel 8086 microprocessor.

Microsoft buys full rights to 86-DOS for $50,000 and then they somehow managed to license it to IBM as MS-DOS under a non-exclusive license, meaning Microsoft could easily license MS-DOS to anyone else without IBM's permission. IBM called this OS PC-DOS.

IBM paid a lovely $430,000 for the MS-DOS + many other software and services that Microsoft provided, and MS-DOS became the very root off which Microsoft grew.

MS-DOS was also open-sourced by Microsoft on April 26, 2024 and you can find the source code here: [github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS](https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS)
